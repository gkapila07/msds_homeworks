Steps to get to tidy Data
-------------------------
1. Reading the beers.csv and brewery.csv into data frames :

	Dataframe Name		File Name

	beers			beers.csv
	breweries		breweries.csv

2. Merging above two datasets into a single data frame 'bd' :

	bd    <- merge(beers, breweries, by.x = "Brewery_id", by.y = "Brew_ID")

3. Setting columnames for the marged data frame :
	
	colnames(bd) <- c("BreweryID","BeerName","BeerID","ABV","IBU","Style","Oz","BreweryName","City","State")

4. Summary of variable names in tidy data frame 'bd'

	Brewery ID			: Unique numeric id of the Brewery
	BeerName			: Name of the beer
	Beer ID				: Unique numeric id of the Brewery
	ABV				: Alcoholic content of the beer by volume
	IBU				: Measure of bitterness of beer : international bitterness unit
	Style				: Style of beer
	Oz				: Ounces of beer
	BreweryName			: Name of the brewery
	City				: City where the brewery is located
	State				: U.S. state where brewery is located
