Raw Data
--------
	- Contained in two files : yob2015.txt and yob2016.txt
	- Above file contains information about popular children names for year 2015, and 2016 respectively. 

	- Above files consists of three columns - each representing the first name, gender and amount of children with that name (for the year)

	- Snapshot of first 5 babyname entries from file yob2015.txt :

 		Emma,F,20415
 		Olivia,F,19638
 		Sophia,F,17381
 		Ava,F,16340
 		Isabella,F,15574



Steps to get to tidy Data
-------------------------
1. Reading the yob2015.txt and yob2016.txt into data frames :

	Dataframe Name		File Name

	df			yob2016.txt
	y2015 			yob2015.txt

2. Assigning variable names to loaded data frame (df):
	
 	colnames(df) <- c('FirstName','Gender','NumberOfChildren')
	colnames(y2015) <- c('FirstName','Gender','NumberOfChildren')

3. Removing duplicate name, and reassigning df to y2016

	y2016 <- df[-grep("yyy",df$FirstName),]

4. Merging y2015 and y2016 data sets into dataframe 'final', with total count of babynames from the two years

	final <- merge(y2015, y2016, by=c("FirstName","Gender"),suffixes = c(".2015",".2016"))
	final$Total <- final$NumberOfChildren.2015+final$NumberOfChildren.2016

5. Summary of variable names in tidy data

	FirstName			: Child's firstname
	Gender				: Child's gender
	NumberOfChildren.2015		: Number of time child's name appears in 2015 raw data
	NumberOfChildren.2016		: Number of time child's name appears in 2015 raw data
	Total				: Total number of times child name appears in both years.
